# Prime Rush (game submission by Harris Lo for Ludum Dare 46 - Keep It Alive)

In the year 2020, an unforeseen catastrophe has forced the Human population to take shelter at home, relying on Online Shopping to purchase all goods. Overwhelmed with purchase orders and endless boxed goods to be shipped out, can YOU keep the packing line alive? Prime Rush is a Tetris-meets-Overcooked co-op game where players attempt to work together to eliminate lines of package boxes slamming through the package line by organizing them into full lines of boxes before shipping them out.
